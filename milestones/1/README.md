This is the first milestone which contains the most basic config. In this config file, you will
build the docker container for this lab using CircleCI's infrastructure.

But before you can trigger a build on CircleCI, you need to sign up for an account. You can do this by going to https://circleci.com/signup/. You will need to sign up for an account. Once you have logged into CircleCI, you can fork this repository into your
GitHub account. 

From there you can onboard your first project to CircleCI by going to the UI, clicking on the projects tab, and click "Create Project" button in the top right. 

The onboarding flow will walk you through on linking your GitHub account, and onboard the repository you just forked into your account.
